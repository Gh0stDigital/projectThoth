/**
 * Dungeon backdrops.
 *
 * The scene window used to show one fixed image for a whole run, so the
 * dungeon looked identical whether you were in a corridor, a treasure room
 * or a boss door. Each situation now names its own art, and because the
 * backdrop is derived from the current event it changes every time the
 * player moves.
 *
 * Each situation lists several candidates rather than one filename:
 *   - The first that exists wins, so art can land one file at a time and
 *     anything still missing quietly falls back instead of breaking.
 *   - Spelling variants sit side by side (corridor / coridoor), and lookup
 *     ignores case and separators, so hand-named art resolves either way.
 *   - Where more than one candidate fits, the choice is seeded from the
 *     event, so a corridor varies between moves but never flickers within
 *     one event.
